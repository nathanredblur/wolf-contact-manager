# WOLF - contact manager app

## Description

This is a contact manager app that allows users to add, edit, delete, and search for contacts. The app is built using Next.js, NextUI, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

This test project is part of the recruitment process for the position of Frontend Developer at WOLF.

My intention is to demonstrate my skills in frontend development, especially in the use of Next.js, NextUI, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. I hope you enjoy the project!

## Creation Process

1. **Planning**: I started by analyzing the requirements and creating a plan for the project. I created a list of features and components that I would need to build the app. I also created a simple wireframe to help me visualize the layout of the app.
2. **Setup**: For this project, I decided to use Next.js, NextUI, Zustan, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. First, I created a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command using nextui as the template. I then installed the necessary dependencies and set up the project structure.
3. **Building the Layout**: I started by building the layout and navigation components. I used the NextUI components to create the layout and navigation bar. I also added a custom theme using Tailwind CSS. I removed unnecessary components and styles from the template and added my own styles. Finally I created a simple landing page and generate a copy text using AI.


## How to Use

Install the dependencies and run the development server.
```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```
